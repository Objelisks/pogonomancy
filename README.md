magic ville

early experiment with lsystems

idea:
* plants drawn using lsystems which are built from some kind of 'genetic' sequence.
* plants drop seeds which have genetic sequence modified from parent.
* each type of plant has a game mechanic associated, so growing plants/splicing builds a tool for exploring an area
