classes of things:
	SEED
	PLANT
	MAGIC



needs:
	particle system
	peer to peer connection
	biological system
	many effects
	interactions

stuff I have to write:
	particle system
	network communication
	dna thingy
	movement
	interactions
	collision resolve


magic effects:
	push
	fire
	frost
	bubble


PLANT
	SEED
	TREE
		L SYSTEM
	FLOWER
	MAGIC
		DNA

DNA COMBINER

PLAYER
	BEARD
	INVENTORY


MAGOFLORA DNA SPLICING

differences:
	shape
		circle, square, star, fill, line, dot
	color
	speed/life
	variance
	branching
		splits,length

hexadecimal dna structure
16 types of everything
16 shapes
	circle fill/line, square fill/line, triangle fill/line
	star, line, pixel, letter, cross, 
16 colors
16 speed levels
16 branching types
	straight, left, right, 2 at 45, 3 at 45, spiral left, spiral right, gravity 2 branch, gravity 3 branch, explode (7 branch), 

GENETICS
	mendelian genetics is a emergent property of the system
	cross algorithm needs to randomly select one of two alleles
	plant has two genes for each trait
	dominant or recessive


MAGIC
levitate = {
	+blue
	+speed
	+up
	-branch
	+line
	effect: {
		push objects upward
	}
}

L SYSTEMS
get a thing up that renders the system so tweaks can be made
parametric grammar
grammar:
	go straight
	turn
	stochasm

structure:
	trunk
	stem
	leaf

A : BCBCBC
B : BCBCBC
C : .



design perspectiv eon mltiplayer cheat prevention
asset risk minimization
save worlds throgh codes, don't tie the world to the player
what if
	git protocol for player interaction
	rollback everything done by just one player

player builds world, gets attached, gets sad when people mess it up.

so
player host
you start off in your own world
you can visit anyone elses wot you can connect to.
default settings whitelist visitors
can switch to blacklist mode
visitors are ghosted

gardens


MANIPULATION OF PLANTS
mostly strange plants, but also anything with direction or parameters
	ie. color effect
		rotate some branches and extend some leaves and you change hue, saturation


moving seeds between worlds should be difficult
	requires portal system which is advanced plant
	purple will be a rare seed


majic sistem
	build out of base elements
	interesting interactions are combinations of base elements
	base elements have no interesting interactions except color/visual effects

interesting interactions
11	weather sun (++heat -clouds)
12	speed (makes things move faster (under their own control))
13	weather	storm (+clouds ++rain)
14	weather	snow (+rain --heat)
15	push (positive constant force)
21	sloth (makes things move slower (under their own control))
22	destruction (removes things from the world)
23	evaporate (removes water around)
24  stunt (decreases speed of growth)
25	fireworks (visual effect)
31	while loop (turing completeness)
32	if statement (turing completeness)
33	water (fills areas below with water)
34	paint (changes colors of things / TODO color over time)
35	pump (moves water)
41	structure ladder (levitate)
42	growth (increases speed of nearby plants / beard growth)
43	structure door (waterfall)
44	genetics (allows insight into genetics of plants)
45	structure wall (purple because modular and shapable)
51	pull (negative constant force)
52	sign (allows communication through symbols or something)
53	anti (gives a temporary shield against effects)
54	portal (allows connection btwn worlds)
55	strange (mysterious effects (maybe reverses other effects))

structure can be shaped through some kind of system

weather control by grouping similar plants
	bases probably have a room which is a weather engine

water logic
	water travels simple paths, falls down sides, maybe also down grooves in middle of block


bending plants allows you to direct their effects if relevant

base elements
1	air light gold
	thin
	affected by wind more
2	fire embre brown
	upwards
	branching
3	water flow pulseblue
	arcs
	willow
4	earth stone browngrey
	roots
	wide flat leaves
5	purple purple purple
	45 deg angles
	geometric

primary secondary
opposite effects generally reflect each other
 12345
1abcde
2fghij
3klmno
4pqrst
5uvwxy


25 unique effects
sub sub effects can be graduated between those
effect gradation

adding another base gives 11 more effects if needed


plants need growth conditions
different kinds have different conditions
	water
	light
	like plants nearby


genetics
	somebits mendelian
	no mixing
	factors (genes)


GENETICS



branching is a whole nother thing
phenotype based off of genotype

these are all based off of base element combinations

ACTUAL GENETICS
one allele is a phenotype
another allele is a phenotype
combined, only dominent alleles activate on any pair

COOL GENETICS




traits
per base
	branch pattern
	color
	angle
	width
	seedshape
per other gene
	strength
	life
	size

growth
	length

var basedna = {
	start: "X", // meta branching
	branching: new Object({
		"X": "F-[[X]+X]+F[+FX]-X", // where on growth to branch
		"F": "FF" // simulates growing
	}), // 
	line: "LINE", // LINE, ARC, RECT
	angle: 0.21, // amount to spread at each branch
	color: "#59AA60", // #RRGGBB
	width: 1.0, // width of line segments
	depth: 3, // recursive depth
	length: 5, // length of line segments (lengthen to grow tree)
	seedShape: "circle" // shape of seeds, maybe make this a polygon for editability
